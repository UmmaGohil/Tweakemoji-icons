# Tweakemoji Icons 
This library enables you to change the size and colour of three Twemojis, of which are named happy, sad and angry. 

## Presets
All twemojis are defaulted at a size of 100 and the normal yellow emoji colour. These two parameters can be changed via <Angry size={100} colour={'red'}> (colour can also be a hex value).

import {Happy, Angry, Sad} from 'twemoji-icons'

<Happy colour={'red'} siz={100}/>
<Sad />
<Angry />
